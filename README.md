## Project Description

This project is a full-stack web application built to demonstrate the integration of front-end and back-end technologies. Users can interact with the interface through dynamic content built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. On the back-end, Node.js is used for server-side logic, SQL/PostgreSQL for database management, and GitHub for version control. The app incorporates cryptographic features to ensure data security.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end:
- **HTML5:** For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **Bootstrap 5:** For a responsive and mobile-first UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For adding dynamic and interactive elements.
- **React.js:** For building reusable UI components and managing the state of the application.

### Back-end:
- **Node.js:** For creating the server and handling requests/responses.
- **Express.js:** For managing routes and server-side logic.
- **SQL/PostgreSQL:** For storing and managing the app's data.

### Version Control:
- **GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.

### Other:
- **Cryptography:** To secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
  
## Features

- **User Authentication:** Login and registration system with encrypted passwords.
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete data via SQL/PostgreSQL.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes with Bootstrap.
- **Dynamic Content:** Real-time updates with React and JavaScript.
- **API Integration:** RESTful APIs for handling data requests.
- **Database Security:** Use of cryptography to ensure data integrity.

## Installation
